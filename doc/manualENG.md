Prelude :
This documentation is an essence intended to scrutinize the depths of the project and its quintessence.
As this succinct abstraction makes clear, this project is a localized instance of resource control. As needs escalate, this project, of course, can be transformed into a network paradigm, which will undoubtedly open horizons for a significant increase in the efficiency of the original functional vectors.
It is also necessary to take into account the author's intention: the formal structure of this document is undoubtedly present, but, departing from the canonical methods of presentation, you will also find a delicate familiarity in the architectonics of the text fragments, which is intended to give the text a refined ease and a graceful lightness of tone.

Prologue:
The author's manner in distinguishing between prelude and prologue is quite intriguing. One gets the impression that he deliberately avoids a straightforward immersion in the project, building the narrative in an emotional and literary way, thereby perhaps seeking to intrigue the reader and arouse anticipation for a deeper exploration of the material presented.

Details : 
At this moment, when the feathers are writing these lines, the sense of a true esprit de corps in our collective is, alas, invisible. However, we are hopeful of the transformation to come. Thus, having poured out our souls about the current state of affairs, let us move on to the essence of the table of contents - DETAILS. 
Details. Oh, this much-loved and, at the same time, due to its ubiquity, extremely trivialized word! Its frequency is so great that there is an involuntary desire to avoid its use in everyday speech.  Involuntarily awakens the greed for philological research in order to find a worthy equivalent to it and clothe our thought in a different lexical garb. Nevertheless, I insist on keeping the term - Details.
Details are the cornerstones of existence, because they often form the whole picture of the universe, give a feeling of coziness in applications, represent captivating features and painstaking elaboration of virtual worlds in modern video games. In cinematic art, they are an integral part of the mise-en-scene and screenplay, the foundation of the narrative structure. The Muse itself is unthinkable without careful attention to detail. The range of meanings of this word is so vast that further enumeration of its connotations seems superfluous. Therefore, it would be more prudent to refrain and only state what it is not: no more verbosity!

I am establishing weighty constants in the Ethics of Common Work, although this paradigm is also applicable to isolated, individual work.
We realize very clearly that every software development follows a certain vector of evolution, and this path is not limited to a couple of trivial steps. Therefore, in addition to accounts, we operate with digital identifiers, a kind of markers, which are designed to characterize and describe in detail the parameters of this or that update (version) of our project.
Readers. What an unimaginable value I have imagined! Oh, reader!  It is very likely that you can easily interpret the marks expressed in numerical symbols, so I will not bother you with unnecessary explanations. The higher the numerical value between the dots and before the dots, the greater the progress made in the development of the project.

=> Mark : **E** - Early

This means that the update is at an early stage of development. It contains only rudiments, barely budding ideas that may not be functional or may be executed with errors.
Therefore, if the update has the name - 1.6.2.00E - this is an early version and, in general, a somewhat rambling version of the subsequent release. The upcoming iteration will certainly be labeled as - 1.6.2.00.

|

=> Mark : **F** - Faults.
This literal means that the author has realized his intentions in this update, but the number of bugs found in it exceeds the acceptable threshold.
We will leave the detailed consideration of the criteria of acceptable and unacceptable errors, as well as the phenomenon of errors as such, for future research.

|

=> Mark : **CCV** - Common Contribution Version.
As the name itself suggests, this version was released thanks to the consolidated contribution of the whole team.

| 

=> Mark : **SM** - Single Module (Single file operation)
The work is concentrated within a single module without affecting the integrity and functionality of the whole project.

=> Mark : **CW** - Comprehensive Work
This version of the project has undergone changes that affect almost all or even all modules without exception. It affects the operability of the project and its visual presentation.

I will not go into a lengthy discussion of comments, but I should emphasize their importance to both researchers and developers. Therefore, writing them is a basic element of work ethics. No excessive effort is required of individuals. That is our freedom, our forward momentum. Our freedom is the keyboard, the ability to put thought into a verbal form that can be seen by others.
